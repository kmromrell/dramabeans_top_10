# dramabeans_top_10
This is a user-friendly, interactive spreadsheet I made to compare top 10 drama lists from users of the K-drama (Korean tv shows) fan-site, Dramabeans. Dramabeans has had an annual "Drama Chat" in which users of the site comment with their Top 10 dramas of all time. I compiled this data for each year, cleaned and standardized the drama names and list format, tallied the data in the spreadsheet, researched and added basic details about each drama (e.g., episodes, year released, genre), and ran basic aggregation functions to determine the users' favorite dramas. I then compared this data across the various years in order to determine the long-standing favorite shows.

You can find the most up-to-date version of the spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16VVIxMJx9h8RcT3A1w3g_0o7vLQ98j7k0P_RHz9jTKo/edit?usp=sharing

Note: The dramachat happens in May, and the spreadsheet is continually updated as people post for the next month. If the sheet seems in-progress, come back later.
